### **Overview**

[Reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16s54ytS4kozrvq4JPGNfR0sbzkSsaZH9?usp=drive_link) from the Thai Maritime Enforcement [Command Center](https://thai-mecc.go.th/thaimeccsite/th/datacenter/list/37) detail incidents on fishing vessels such as incursions into restricted waters and medical emergencies at sea. We have these reports but they are in Thai and in PDF form. We need to find a way to first translate them into English and then search them for any mentions of our list of vessels related to FMFO.

### **Objective(s)**

* Produce translated versions of each PDF  
  * Produce a spreadsheet that contains the google drive links to any reports that mention the ship.

### **Requirements & Suggested Approach**

1. Use this list of [ships](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B3fZdyk2DF6U4NyPqkyB2tqImWbPrm83fiwN67iJVpU/edit?usp=sharing) to search against  
   * That spreadsheet has a column for adding links  
2. Use this list of [reports](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16s54ytS4kozrvq4JPGNfR0sbzkSsaZH9?usp=drive_link)  
   * Place translated versions in the same folder with the prefer “translated\_{existing file name}”  
3. Translating the PDFs is a bit of a challenge and if you need to use any kind of paid service – which I think is likely – just let me know so I’m aware and then go ahead and use it.

**Deliverables**

1. **Translated versions of PDFs**  
2. **Completed spreadsheet with links for each search hit in the relevant column for each row**  
3. **Documentation**  
   * Includes all relevant code files  
   * **Excludes all API keys and passwords** so the code can be shared publicly.
