After the arrest, a group of anchovy purse seine fishermen were dissatisfied and brought their boats to block the Pak Bara Canal Canal as a symbolic gesture. The fishermen explained that the Fisheries Act and the National Park Act overlapped areas, leaving these fishing boats with no place to make a living. Therefore, more boats were brought in to block the canal, preventing speedboats from picking up and dropping off tourists, and potentially affecting the entry and exit of large commercial fishing boats.
